# Introduction (defunct)
EU-BIKE is a Swedish bike sharing service available in some bigger and smaller Swedish cities.
### Viewing bikes

**PLEASE NOTE: EUBIKE has had some serious problems related to displaying correct locations of bikes. I know that because I have tried their system and I have read some reviews online. With that said, not all bike locations are inaccurate.**

To see the list of available bikes for a location, you don´t need any authentication. The app "EU-BIKE" is connecting to an Alibaba Cloud server
at the IP "47.91.87.181" at port 8080.
This is a basic URL to list available bikes:
http://47.91.87.181:8080/UserApi/AppUser?lng=18.0668918788433075&lat=59.3109666242335791&cmd=areabike&dist=0.5 (**POST**)
The app adds a "logintoken" to the request, but it is not required in order to see bikes.
Here is a detailed explaination of each accepted key in the request:
**lng**: The longtitude of the search.
**lat**: The latitude of the search.
**cmd**: I am unsure what this means, butit it is probably to identify the query request.
**dist**: The distance (from the latitude and longtitude parameters) to perform a seach from. Probably in a radius format and in kilometers. Doesn´t seem to have an upper limit. The app´s default value when performing a search is 0.5.

Example response (in JSON, with a distance value of 0.5):

Explaination of values returned in the response:

**success**: Pretty self-explainatory. Indicates if a request has failed or not.

**Please note: If there is no bikes available at the performed query, the server will return False as the success value and "Interface call error" in a "msg" parameter.**

### Bike object (listed in the "data" list returned on a successfull request):

**devid** : The device ID of the bike. This ID is probably used when unlocking a bike, but I have not confirmed that.

**sheibeistatus** : Unconfirmed. Seems to always be set to zero.

**devlat** : The latitude position of the bike.

**devlng** : The longtitude position of the bike.

**devpower** : Probably has to do with the device power, but it seems to always be set to zero, even with bikes that have power.

**dist** : The distance to the bike from the coordinates given in the request. This value is most likely in kilometers.

**maparea** : Not confirmed.
