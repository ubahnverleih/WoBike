# Bluegogo (defunct)

POST-Request to `https://api-us.bluegogo.com/nearbyBikes?data={"token":"","version":1,"data":{"latitude":22.5526,"longitude":114.1029,"billingModelIds":"1,2,3"}}`

(The JSON should be URLencoded.) â€“ If the token is empty, the bikelist will also be empty. I guess you get a token when signing in.
